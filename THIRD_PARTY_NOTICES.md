## python-dateutil

`src/shape/profile/reference/_dateutil_parser.py` is a port of the date/time string parser of
python-dateutil 2.9.0 (`dateutil/parser/_parser.py`), kept so that Shape classifies and parses
date text the way pandas (which falls back on dateutil) and therefore Spindle do, without
depending on the package.
