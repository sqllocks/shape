# Changelog

Shape is in **early access**. Profiling is available now; data generation and
pipeline integration are in progress. See `docs/plans/COMPLETION_PLAN.md`.

## Unreleased

- `shape fidelity REFERENCE SYNTHETIC` (alias `compare`): scores synthetic tables against reference
  tables, per column, per table and overall, on a 0-100 scale, and writes JSON, Markdown or HTML
  reports (`-o`, repeatable; the `shape.reports` plugin group). Pass marks `--min-score`,
  `--min-table-score` and `--min-column-score`; exit 0 on pass, 1 on failure, 2 for bad input. The
  scoring equals the one the generation equivalence standard (plan T-21 clause h) asserts per
  table, to within 1e-9, and a missing column or table scores 0 and an empty reference fails. See
  `docs/FIDELITY.md`. `shape fidelity PROFILE.json DATA.csv` certifies as before.
- Fixes: `certify` scored a column missing from the generated data 1.0 and passed a profile that
  describes no columns (a missing column now scores 0; an empty profile fails); `shape
  certify-shapes` always exited 0 (it now exits 3 when the score is below `--threshold`, default
  0.9).

- Enum rule: a profiled column is an enum (`is_enum`, with every value in `enum_values`) only if,
  besides the existing size limits (fewer than 200 distinct values, or a distinct ratio under 0.30
  with fewer than 50,000), its values repeat: distinct values are at most half of the non-null
  values, and a unique column is never an enum. Before, every column of a table under 200 rows
  was an enum, unique keys, e-mails and free text included, so generation from a profile
  resampled only those exact values. Same rule in both kernels and in the SQL Server plugin's
  sampled profile. `value_counts_ext` (the top 500 values) is unchanged.
- `shape from-ddl FILE`: reads SQL `CREATE TABLE` DDL (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, ANSI; inline,
  table-level and `ALTER TABLE` foreign keys) into a generation schema, with smart inference of
  distributions, key patterns, row ratios, seasonality, correlations and business rules
  (`--smart`, the default; `--explain` prints each decision). See `docs/GENERATION_ENGINE.md`.
  Fixes in the import: a column-level `REFERENCES parent(col)` is a foreign key to that column
  (it was ignored, and the guessed key could name a column that does not exist); `VARBINARY(MAX)`,
  `BINARY(MAX)` and the `BLOB` types are binary and left out; names match whole words
  (`discount_pct` is a percentage, `state` is a state and not a status, `model` is not a category,
  a `catalog` table is not a log); `gender CHAR(1)` and other one-character codes get a value set;
  a parent's total is the sum of its child rows (CR-08); a key the DDL does not declare, guessed
  by name (`customer_id`), points at the parent's primary key (it pointed at
  `customer.customer_id`, which usually does not exist) and is not guessed when the parent has no
  single-column key; `CustomerId` and `CustomerID` are read like `customer_id`; generated strings
  never exceed the declared length (`country_code CHAR(2)` got six digits).
- Stream profiling runtime (`shape.streaming`): tumbling, sliding, session and global windows over
  Arrow micro-batches profiled in bounded mode, with watermarks, allowed lateness and a late-data
  policy; windows can be snapshotted and restored exactly. Bounded per-key sketches (LRU, TTL, a hard
  memory cap), a vectorized windowed `Deduplicator`, and a `StreamConsumer` that commits offsets and
  window state in atomic checkpoints, resumes after a restart and reconnects without replaying.
  Fixes: `TumblingWindow` could not be restored, keyed state grew without bound, `deduplicate_ids`
  looped over every row, and a reconnect replayed the batches already delivered. See
  `docs/specs/STREAMING_SEMANTICS.md`.
- `shape verify`: validation gates (schema conformance, nulls, primary keys, foreign keys,
  ranges, temporal consistency, file format, schema drift, distributions), a quarantine for
  failed files and tables, and a Markdown or JSON report. See `docs/VERIFY.md`.
- Relicensed under the MIT license.
- Repository cleaned up for public release: removed internal milestone and
  qualification records.
- README and changelog rewritten to describe the current state.
