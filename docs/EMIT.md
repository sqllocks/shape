# Emitting events: `shape emit`

`shape emit` turns a domain (or a generation schema file) into a stream of events: the same rows
`shape generate` writes (same schema, seed and scale), one JSON object per line, in a
deterministic order. The runtime is `shape.streaming.emit`; sinks for Kafka, Event Hubs and
Fabric come from emitter plugins (`shape.emitters`).

```bash
shape emit retail --scale small --max-events 5                       # events on standard output
shape emit retail --realtime --rate 10000 --duration 60 --sink file -o events.jsonl
shape emit retail --realtime --rate 500 --burst 30:10:4 --out-of-order 0.05 \
      --anomaly-fraction 0.01 --sink file -o events.jsonl
```

## Events

A flat event (the default) is the row's columns plus:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `_shape_table` | the table the row belongs to |
| `_shape_seq` | the row's position in its table, from 0 |
| `_shape_event_time` | the table's first date or timestamp column, when it has one |

**The idempotency key is `(_shape_table, _shape_seq)`.** A replay produces the same key for the
same row. `--envelope cloudevents` wraps each flat event as a CloudEvents 1.0 structured JSON event
(`id` is `<table>/<seq>`, `type` is `shape.<table>.row`, the flat event is the `data`).

JSON values: dates and timestamps are ISO-8601 strings, decimals are strings, binary is base64,
non-finite floats are `null`.

Tables are streamed one after another in dependency order; `--table NAME` (repeatable) selects.
A table that a post-pass changes (computed columns, rule repair, correlated columns) is generated
whole once, so its rows equal `shape generate`'s; the others are read chunk by chunk.

## Rate

* `--no-realtime` (the default): as fast as the sink takes events.
* `--realtime --rate N`: N events per second (default 100). Each batch is sent at its absolute due
  time, so the long-run rate equals N whatever the sleep overshoot. A sink that is too slow makes
  the run fall behind its schedule; no event is dropped, and the report shows the worst lag.
* `--burst START:DURATION:MULT` (repeatable, needs `--realtime`): from START seconds for DURATION
  seconds the rate is MULT times `--rate`. Bursts may not overlap.
* `--max-events N`: stop when N events have been delivered *in all* (a position in the stream, so a
  resumed run stops at the same place). `--duration S`: stop after S seconds of this run.

## Out of order and anomalies

* `--out-of-order F`: each event, with probability F, is delivered late: it moves 1 to
  `--ooo-window` (default 1000) places later, inside its window. Its event time is unchanged.
* `--anomaly-fraction F`: each event, with probability F, has its values mutated through the
  `shape.chaos` mutator protocol (`--anomaly-mutator NAME`, repeatable; the default is
  `value-anomaly`, which turns one non-key value of the row into an outlier or a null). The same
  rows are chosen on every run. A mutator used here must keep the row count and schema, because
  `_shape_seq` is the row position.

Both are row-addressed draws from the seed, so the stream is the same on every run and after a
restart.

## Delivery, backpressure and checkpoints

Delivery is **at-least-once**. A batch is delivered when the sink's `send` returns, and only then
can the checkpoint move past it. A bounded queue sits between the generator and the sink, so a
slow sink blocks the generator (`--queue-batches`); transient `OSError`s are retried
(`--retries`).

A checkpoint (`--checkpoint FILE`; for `--sink file` the default is `<output>.checkpoint`) is an
atomic JSON document with the offset, a fingerprint of everything that decides the sequence, and
whether the run completed. It is written every `--checkpoint-every` events and every
`--checkpoint-seconds`, and always on shutdown: the end of the data, a limit, SIGINT or SIGTERM,
or an error. After a crash (even `kill -9`), run the same command again:

* it resumes at the checkpoint's offset, so events after the checkpoint may be sent a second time;
* a file sink continues the file (a half-written last line is cut first);
* **a consumer that keeps the first event of each key sees exactly the uninterrupted stream**
  (`shape.streaming.emit.read_events(path, dedupe=True)`);
* a checkpoint of a different stream (other schema, seed, scale or option) is refused;
  `--fresh` starts over, and a finished run is not repeated.

A run with no checkpoint (the console sink, or no `--checkpoint`) starts from the beginning.

## Limits

* The first block of a table with post-passes waits for the whole schema to generate.
* Event order across tables is fixed (table by table); there is no interleaving.
* Rate accuracy depends on the sink keeping up; `max_lag` in the report says whether it did.
